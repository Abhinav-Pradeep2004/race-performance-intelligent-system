# Race Performance Intelligence System (RPIS)
Race Performance Monitoring &amp; Strategy Dashboard

A race performance and strategy analysis tool using public Formula 1 data (via FastF1).  
The goal is to simulate a simplified race engineering workflow: analyzing lap and stint performance, modelling tyre degradation, and exploring basic race strategy scenarios through an interactive dashboard.

## Current status
- Project planning in progress (charter, WBS, Gantt).
- Development environment set up.
- Data ingestion and analysis modules to be implemented next.

## Tech stack
- Python
- FastF1, pandas, numpy
- Streamlit, plotly
